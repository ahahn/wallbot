![Overview of complete Wallbot](images/wallbot-overview.jpg?raw=true "Wallbot Overview")

This is the complete repo for my wallbot project.
The wallbot is a simple two-motor Cartesian robot that draws on vertical surfaces.  I use it to draw on whiteboards and windows with dry erase markers.

The [designs directory](designs) has all of the laser cut designs to make the physical parts of the machine.
Assembly instructions are included as well.

Other components which are needed for the wallbot:
1) Raspberry pi model 3 (other models will probably work) running raspbian or another linux with node.js installed.
(https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-RASPBERRYPI3-MODB-1GB-Model-Motherboard/dp/B01CD5VC92 plus a microSD card > 8GB and a higher amp power cable like this https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Supply-Adapter-Listed/dp/B00MARDJZ4 ) (about $55 all together)
2) Arduino UNO (other models will probably work) (about $20)
3) Adafruit motor shield ( https://www.adafruit.com/product/1438 ) (about $20)
4) Heatsinks for motor shield PWM drivers ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FDWCR12 ) (about $12)
5) 2 x NEMA-17 Stepper motors (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C1MVTZC) (about $12)
6) 1 Servo motor
7) 2 x 40 teeth drive belt pulleys w/ 5mm bore (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K69PFVN) (about $10)
8) 2 x 5m 6mm drive belt (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078SPNKS1) (about $13)
9) 2 Suction cup mounts (like https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001447JYG ) (about $25)

That's about $175 of parts all together.

The mounts for the motors, electronics, and pen can all be laser cut from plywood.  The pen mount design should be cut from 1/8" wood, and weights and motor mounts should be cut from 1/4" wood.
